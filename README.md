# Voter Service

## Introduction

The Voter [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) Service is a RESTful Web Service, backed by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). The Voter service exposes several HTTP API endpoints, listed below. API users can review a list candidates, submit a candidate, view voting results, and inspect technical information about the running service. API users can also create random voting data by calling the `/voter/simulation` endpoint.

The Voter service is designed to work along with the [Candidate Service](https://github.com/garystafford/candidate-service), as part of a complete API. The Voter service is dependent on the Candidate service to supply a list of candidates. The Candidate service is called by the Voter service, using one of three methods:
1. [HTTP-based Synchronous IPC](https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-microservices-inter-process-communication/), when either the Voter service's `/voter/candidates/election/{election}` or `/voter/simulation/election/{election}` endpoints are called.
2. [Messaging-based Remote Procedure Call (RPC) IPC](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-spring-amqp.html), when either the Voter service's `/voter/candidates/rpc/election/{election}` or `/voter/simulation/rpc/election/{election}` endpoints are called.
3. [Messaging-based Eventual Consistency](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-spring-amqp.html), when either the Voter service's `/voter/candidates/db/election/{election}` or `/voter/simulation/db/election/{election}` endpoints are called.

## Quick Start for Local Development

The Voter service requires MongoDB to be running locally, on port `27017`, RabbitMQ running on `5672` and `15672`, and the Candidate service to be running on `8097`. To clone, build, test, and run the Voter service as a JAR file, locally:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch rabbitmq \
  https://github.com/garystafford/voter-service.git
cd voter-service
./gradlew clean cleanTest build
java -jar build/libs/voter-service-0.3.0.jar
```
## Quick Start with Docker
The easiest way to run the Voter API services locally is using the `docker-compose-local.yml` file, included in the project. The Docker Compose file will spin up single container instances of the Election service, Voter service, Candidate service, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, and the Voter API Gateway.

```bash
sh ./stack-deploy-local.sh
```

```

## Getting Started with the API
The easiest way to get started with the Candidate and Voter services API, using [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) from the command line:  
1. Create sample candidates: `http http://localhost:8097/candidate/simulation`  
2. View sample candidates: `http http://localhost:8097/candidate/candidates/summary/election/2016%20Presidential%20Election`  
3. Create sample voter data: `http http://localhost:8099/voter/simulation/election/2016%20Presidential%20Election`  
4. View sample voter results: `http http://localhost:8099/voter/results`

Alternately, for step 3 above, you can use service-to-service RPC IPC with RabbitMQ, to retrieve the candidates:  
`http http://localhost:8099/voter/simulation/rpc/election/2016%20Presidential%20Election`

Alternately, for step 3 above, you can use eventual consistency using RabbitMQ, to retrieve the candidates from MongoDB (assumes candidates are already be in MongoDB):  
`http http://localhost:8099/voter/simulation/db/election/2016%20Presidential%20Election`

## Voter Service Endpoints

The service uses a context path of `/voter`. All endpoints must be are prefixed with this sub-path.

## Voting

Submitting a new candidate requires an HTTP `POST` request to the `/voter/votes` endpoint, as follows:

HTTPie

```text
http POST http://localhost:8099/voter/votes \
  candidate="Jill Stein" \
  election="2016 Presidential Election"
```

cURL

```text
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "candidate": "Jill Stein", "election": "2016 Presidential Election" }' \
  "http://localhost:8099/voter/votes"
```

wget

```text
wget --method POST \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --body-data '{ "candidate": "Jill Stein", "election": "2016 Presidential Election" }' \
  --no-verbose \
  --output-document - http://localhost:8099/voter/votes
```

## Continuous Integration

The project's source code is continuously built and tested on every commit to [GitHub](https://github.com/garystafford/voter-service), using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/garystafford/voter-service). If all unit tests pass, the resulting Spring Boot JAR is pushed to the `build-artifacts` branch of the [voter-service](https://github.com/garystafford/voter-service/tree/build-artifacts) GitHub repository. The JAR's filename is incremented with each successful build (i.e. `voter-service-0.2.10.jar`).

## Spring Profiles

The Voter service includes several Spring Boot Profiles, in a multi-profile YAML document: `src/main/resources/application.yml`. The profiles are `default`, `docker-development`, `docker-production`, and `aws-production`. You will need to ensure your MongoDB instance is available at that `host` address and port of the profile you choose, or you may override the profile's properties.


```yaml
endpoints:
  enabled: true
  sensitive: false

  java:
    source: "${java.version}"
logging:
  level:
    root: INFO

```

All profile property values may be overridden on the command line, or in a `.conf` file. For example, to start the Voter service with the `aws-production` profile, but override the `mongodb.host` value with a new host address, you might use the following command:

```bash
java -jar <name_of_jar_file> \
  --spring.profiles.active=aws-production \
  --spring.data.mongodb.host=<new_host_address>
  -Dlogging.level.root=DEBUG \
  -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom
```
